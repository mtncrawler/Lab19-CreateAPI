### To-Do API

## Challenge
Starting from an empty MVC template, Create an API that allows a user to Create individual ToDo tasks, and put them in a ToDoList. Using both of the resources above, create an API in .NET Core that conducts the standard HTTP verbs (Get,Put,Post,Delete) for a “To-Do” list. Your “To-Do” list will consist of individual tasks that can be saved into the database and extracted as needed. You should also have the ability to get all of the tasks by a simple get request. Use a SQL database and deploy to Azure.
